# Scardot Engine

## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**Scardot is a fork of scardot from before the social media managers started blocking their supporters
At least we hope so.
We mainly want to play it safe and not involve ourselves in the drama
But any contirbutions are welcome.
Hell we might as well make this our own thing, integrate shit, add OG xbox support. Why not?

## Free, open source and community-driven

Scardot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. scardot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations.

Before being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/scardotengine/scardot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),
scardot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project)
for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire
titles.
